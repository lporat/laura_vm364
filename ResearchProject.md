#Creating a regenerating object
##I had this cog that I wanted to regenerate and go across the screen in order to serve as an obstacle for my character

I imported in my cog as a still image. Then I used Unity's animation tool to animate the rotation

I made my cog into a prefab and named it Spawner. Then I wrote a script that a Lynda.com video provided.

The script sets up the delay range for the spawn regeneration and it instatiates the cog at the set point in which I physically placed it at.
