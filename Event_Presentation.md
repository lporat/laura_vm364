#Anime Boston
Due to a stroke of good luck and some serious hardcore anime fans at Emerson, I got tickets to Anime Boston for free. 
Anime Boston is a yearly convention dedicated to Japanese animation and manga. It's a huge event attracting nearly 30,000
people per year. The convention has vendors selling memorabilla, various panels dedicated to the different aspects of anime,
karaoke, a masquerade, a video game room, and so much more.
