#Anime Boston
Due to a stroke of good luck and some serious hardcore anime fans at Emerson, I got tickets to Anime Boston for free. 
Anime Boston is a yearly convention dedicated to Japanese animation and manga. It's a huge event attracting nearly 30,000
people per year. The convention has vendors selling memorabilla, various panels dedicated to the different aspects of anime,
karaoke, a masquerade, a video game room, and so much more.

Imagine an entire convention center filled to the brim with cosplayers. That's Anime Boston in a nutshell.

One of the panels I went to was called the History of Video Gaming. It was a very interesting panel since it was one of the
few panels at Anime Boston that wasn't about anime. The panelist covered the history of video games from its first inception
to the present. To my surprise, I found out that Tennis for Two was the first video game and not Pong like I had initially 
thought! You learn something new every day. Space War! was another early video game that first used Newtonian physics in it.
While Pong wasn't the first video game, it was the first commercially successful game. 

After the first few video games came out, arcade games exploded in popularity. The first commercially successful console was the Atari VCS.

In 1983, there was the video game crash. The market at that point was so oversaturated with games that people were no longer
buying any new games. It lasted two years from 1983 to 1985. It was a disaster for video game manufacturers especially Atari. In 1982, they released E.T. which was one of the biggest commercial failures in video gaming history. This caused
many doubts whether video games could ever be a viable long-term business. 

Luckily, the game industry recovered from the crash. The 90s saw improvements in video game graphics with the SNES that had 16 bit graphics and it was the best selling console of the era. The 90s also the introduction of portable consoles with the Game Boy which was released in 1989 in Japan. 

The end of the '90s and into the 2000s cemented the "big three" video game console manufacturers which were Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony. Sega, Atari, and the others were out.
