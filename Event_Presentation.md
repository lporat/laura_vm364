#Anime Boston
Due to a stroke of good luck and some serious hardcore anime fans at Emerson, I got tickets to Anime Boston for free. 
Anime Boston is a yearly convention dedicated to Japanese animation and manga. It's a huge event attracting nearly 30,000
people per year. The convention has vendors selling memorabilla, various panels dedicated to the different aspects of anime,
karaoke, a masquerade, a video game room, and so much more.

Imagine an entire convention center filled to the brim with cosplayers. That's Anime Boston in a nutshell.

One of the panels I went to was called the History of Video Gaming. It was a very interesting panel since it was one of the
few panels at Anime Boston that wasn't about anime. The panelist covered the history of video games from its first inception
to the present. To my surprise, I found out that Tennis for Two was the first video game and not Pong like I had initially 
thought! You learn something new every day. Space War! was another early video game that first used Newtonian physics in it.
While Pong wasn't the first video game, it was the first commercially successful game. 

After the first few video games came out, arcade games exploded in popularity. The first commercially successful console was the Atari VCS.
