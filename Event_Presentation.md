#Anime Boston
Due to a stroke of good luck and some serious hardcore anime fans at Emerson, I got tickets to Anime Boston for free. 
Anime Boston is a yearly convention dedicated to Japanese animation and manga. It's a huge event attracting nearly 30,000
people per year. The convention has vendors selling memorabilla, various panels dedicated to the different aspects of anime,
karaoke, a masquerade, a video game room, and so much more.

Imagine an entire convention center filled to the brim with cosplayers. That's Anime Boston in a nutshell.

One of the panels I went to was called the History of Video Gaming. It was a very interesting panel since it was one of the
few panels at Anime Boston that wasn't about anime. The panelist covered the history of video games from its first inception
to the present. To my surprise, I found out that Tennis for Two was the first video game and not Pong like I had initially 
thought! You learn something new every day. Space War! was another early video game that first used Newtonian physics in it.
While Pong wasn't the first video game, it was the first commercially successful game. 

After the first few video games came out, arcade games exploded in popularity. The first commercially successful console was the Atari VCS.

In 1983, there was the video game crash. The market at that point was so oversaturated with games that people were no longer
buying any new games. It lasted two years from 1983 to 1985. It was a disaster for video game manufacturers especially Atari. In 1982, they released E.T. which was one of the biggest commercial failures in video gaming history. This caused
many doubts whether video games could ever be a viable long-term business. 

Luckily, the game industry recovered from the crash. The 90s saw improvements in video game graphics with the SNES that had 16 bit graphics and it was the best selling console of the era. The 90s also the introduction of portable consoles with the Game Boy which was released in 1989 in Japan. 

The end of the '90s and into the 2000s cemented the "big three" video game console manufacturers which were Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony. Sega, Atari, and the others were out. 

The video game industry today is rapidly undergoing changes. The introduction of Kickstarter has allowed indie creators to make their own games funded by people around the world rather than having to fund their games themselves or having to work for a big video game manufacturer. There is a greater diversity of games coming out these days thanks to kickstarter. 

Interestingly enough, the video game industry has a huge reliance on Metacritic scores. Metacritic is a review aggregation site in which people can rate the games they have played. Video game publishers use Metacritic scores as a way to make deals with video game developers. Metacritic scores are crucial in negotating deals with developers as a good score can mean big bonuses but a bad score can jeapordize their deals. Higher reviews mean more money and lower reviews mean less money. For example, Bethesda was going to give developer Obsidian a bonus if Fallout: New Vegas averaged an 85 on Metacritic. However, the game averaged slightly less than an 85 (it got an 84) and Obsidian didn't get their bonus. 

New technologies are also dramatically impacting the industry. It is too early to tell how Virtual Reality will change the industry with the introduction of the Oculus Rift but it should be exciting to witness. 

After the panel ended, I went to a huge room in which they had a bunch of video game stations set up. They had games like Super Smash Bros but there were a bunch of cool Japanese games I hadn't seen before.

This was a dancing game that relied on software similar to the Xbox kinnect and it would be able to tell where the players' positions and what their movements were like in order to give them a score.
